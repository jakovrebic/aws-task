    - using ansible, install and configure nginx and aws-cli on the VMs

    - configure nginx to return a custom header "X-Infobip: cloud-test" on each HTTP response
    - grant access to a created S3 bucket to those IAM users
    - read-only for "lin-read" VM and read-write access to "lin-write" VM
    - write 2 bash scripts and set them to run every hour and 14 minutes
    - on "lin-read" script should pull/sync all the files from S3 bucket
    - on "lin-write" script should generate a dummy file with the timestamp and upload it to S3 bucket
